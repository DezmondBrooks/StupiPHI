This system exist to bridge the gap between production data and dev and staging test data. Due to privacy laws in health care pulling patient records into a dev env for debugging is often not possible.
The system aims to depersonalize patient identifing information using AI. Allowing devs to pull on acurrate real world data for accurate testing and debugging, without directly housing PII locally. 

The system will not change anything besides PHI/PII . The system will not put the changes into the target database. the deliverable is a parsable file for easy record creation.

A correct outcome is all PII/PHI being removed/redacted or faked
faked: John => Bob

A dangerous outcome is PII remains in records. System becomes a security risk/ weak point for attackers.
